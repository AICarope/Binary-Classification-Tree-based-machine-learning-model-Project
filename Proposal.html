1. Domain Background

HYPERAKTIV is a public dataset containing health, activity, andheart rate data from adult patients diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, better known as ADHD.
The dataset consists of data collected from 51 adult patients with ADHD and 52 adult for clinical-controls. A total of 103 adult patients.
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a diverse chronic condition affecting nearly five percent of the adult population. 
The disorder often severely impacts social and occupational functioning,as well as quality of life for those affected [38]. ADHD diagnostics is
currently based on subjective evaluation and clinical observations, and it is therefore a need for more objective methods [23, 35]

Adult ADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the core symptoms hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Symptoms must be present over time and negatively affect social, academic, or occupational functioning to qualify for the ADHD diagnosis. Inattention seems to be the primary feature of adult ADHD,
characterized by disorganization and distraction, problems with staying on task and focused, as well as a propensity for persistent
daydreaming. Many adults also have symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity, such as talkativeness, constant restlessness, and an
inclination towards taking spontaneous decisions without evaluating potential consequences. Among children with ADHD, the latter
condition generally has a more substantial manifestation [38]. Another difference between adult and pediatric ADHD is that ADHD
seems to be a predominantly male disorder among children [29]. This gender difference becomes more equalized among adults [38].
Stimulants are considered the most effective medications for ADHD treatment. However, such medications have a pronounced potential
for misuse and dependency. In general, adult ADHD is associated with an increased risk of developing substance-use disorders [38].
Furthermore, adult ADHD is also often concurrent with other psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders, as well as
sleeplessness [29, 34, 38].



2. Problem Statement

##Potential use cases
    a. Predict individuals that has ADHD and have a high level of activity data and hrv files
    b. Analyze the associations between ADHD and other illness (interested) (y = illness Target variable) (x = adhd, AGE,  0 or 1 boolean) Nte: matbe ASRS for later
    c. Potential advance diagnosis and treatments (maybe)
    d. Predict individuals that has ADHD and subtance (addiction) abuse (interested) maybe in b.
    e. Predict individuals with adhd and present emotional inestability (interested) 

    Decision: b and d.
    
    Problem:  Analyze the associations between adults with ADHD and co-occurring conditions such as anxiety, substance abuse. Understanding the age range
    to gain insights into their interrelationships and potential predictive factors.
     e.g., Predict whether an adult patient with ADHD will develop anxiety
           Predict whether an adult patient with ADHD will subtance abuse
           Predict whether an adult patient with ADHD will other conditions

Note: (9) Unknonw values have been removed ffrom the data set. (2) Control have been updated to (0) for healthy individuals.

    Objective: Understanding these associations can aid in early identification, intervention, and personalized treatment strategies
    for individuals with ADHD and coexisting conditions.

        1. Explore the patterns and associations between ADHD and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and age.
        2. Develop predictive models to identify potential risk factors or indicators for the co-occurrence of ADHD with other conditions.
        3. Provide insights that can contribute to the development of targeted interventions and personalized treatment approaches for individuals with ADHD and co-occurring conditions.
    Significance: This research can potentially improve clinical practices, enhance early detection strategies, and contribute to the overall well-being of individuals affected by these conditions.

3. Data Set Inputs
A total of 103 patients were recruited, 51 of which were diagnosed with ADHD, and 52 with other diagnoses (clinical controls). The Norwegian Regional
Medical Research Ethics Committee West approved the original protocol for the data collection, and all processes were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The data collected
were recordings of motor activity and heart rate, the output of a computerized test of attention-related problems, as well as various
diagnostic and clinical assessments [10–12]

The dataset is organized into four different items that can be found in the root directory. 
    1)activity_data contains the activity data collected from all participants, organized into separate files. Each file starts with few lines of metadata before the activity measurements start. 
    2)hrv_data contains the heart rate data collected from all participants, and like the activity data, it is separated into one file per participant. Each file starts with two lines of metadata before the IBI values start. 
    2a) hyperaktiv_with_controls
    3)CPT_II_ConnersContinuousPerformanceTest.csv contains the individual responses of the 360 CPT-II test trials, the omission and commission errors, and the ADHD Confidence Index. The file names features.csv contains the pre-extracted features used to perform the
    experiments presented in Section 7 of the white paper. Each line in the file corresponds to features for a single participant. 
    4)patient_info.csv #contains all the information featured in Section 4 of the white paper. The file consists of 32 different columns, where each line corresponds to features
    for a single participant. In addition to the activity and heart rate data, also includes a series of patient attributes such as their age, sex, and information about their mental state, as well as output data from a computerized neuropsychological test.

        **********Variables in: patient_info.csv
        1. ID:Patient ID
        2. SEX:Male (0),Female (1)
        3. AGE: Participant ages are presented in four groups, where (1) = 17-29 years, (2) = 30-39 years, (3) = 40-49 years and (4) = 50-67 years.
        4. ACC:  Identifies the participants who have recorded motor activity. The dichotomous variable ACC identifies the participants who have
        recorded motor activity (N/Y)
        5. ACC-TIME: The ACC-TIME variable tells when the recordings were started (HH:MM)
        6. ACC-DAYS:gives the number of 24h cycles recorded for each participant. The 45 patients with ADHD recorded motor activity for 6.6 ± 1.3 days (mean ±
        standard derivation), and the 40 clinical controls recorded motor activity for 7.2 ± 0.9 days
        7. HRV:Heart rate was recorded naturalistically with the chest-worn ECG-based monitoring device Actiheart (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd, England) [3]. 
        The dichotomous variable HRV identifies the participants who have recorded heart rate (N/Y)
        8. HRV-HOURS: HRVHOURS gives the approximate number of hours heart rate was recorded for each participant. A total of 80 participants provided
        heart rate recordings: 38 ADHD patients for an average of 20.5±3.9 hours, and 42 clinical controls for 21 ± 4.3 hours.
        8A. HRV-TIME: Tells when the recordings were started (HH:MM)
        9. CPT-II:Conner’s Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) is a computerized neuropsychological test which evaluates impulsivity and
        sustained attention by response or nonresponse to various letters presented for 250 milliseconds on the PC screen. CPT-II contains 360
        trials divided into six blocks, defined by the time interval between the presented letters [25]. CPT-II calculates and outputs various
        estimates, like omission and commission errors, as well as a clinical ADHD Confidence Index score (range 0–100). However, analyzing
        the raw data (the responses of the 360 trials) has previously been fruitful for distinguishing between patient groups in the current
        dataset [12]. In total, 49 clinical controls and 50 participants with ADHD completed the CPT-II test
